# Stress_classification
This project aims to classify different levels of stress based on physical observations collected from individuals. Leveraging the capabilities of scikit-learn and the KNeighborsClassifier algorithm, the system utilizes features such as heart rate variability, skin conductivity, and other physiological indicators to predict stress levels.

## Tools
The KNeighborsClassifier algorithm, a part of scikit-learn's machine learning toolkit, is employed to classify stress levels. It works by identifying the stress level of a person based on the similarity of their physical observations to previously labeled data points.

## Outcome 
Through this project, we seek to develop a robust and accurate model that can assist in stress level assessment, providing valuable insights for both individuals and healthcare professionals. By leveraging machine learning techniques and physiological data, we aim to contribute to better stress management and overall well-being.
